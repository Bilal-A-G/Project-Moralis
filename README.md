# Project-Mortalis
An FPS game that is a continuation of/successor to my previous FPS project, Unnamed FPS Game. This project uses the [W_I_Zr_Ds package](https://github.com/Bilal-A-G/W_I_Zr_Ds-Tools), it is more or less a long term game project + showcase of the capabilities of W_I_Zr_Ds.

This is a Unity project, so you can download the repo, extract it, and open with Unity Hub to load, alternatively, you can check out the itch page linked below. However, this game is currently going through a massive shift in aesthetics as I felt that the itch build version looked fairly bland.

All work for this project has been done by me, except for sounds.
